5:17 pm
Sitting in airport
about to connect to wifi
older man walks up to me
asks to see if I can look up something on Google maps
wondering if there's another route into his city, aside from the 35
help him define his route 130 - 10 - 1640

Originally from Pittsburgh, but left in 69
He joined the Air Force, met his wife who was in the Army
She was an officer during the times of Vietnam but never went to war.

I tell him I'm from San Diego, waiting on my parents and nephew who are set to arrive at 6:06 pm

He said he's been to San Diego and has a friend who works in the Post Office, in SD

Tells me about San Antonio
the day after Thanksgiving (light up the river walk)
colorful Christmas lights

Talks about the Fiesta, some neighborhood tradition that lasts for 10 days

Tells me about Sea World, and some other waterpark (Fiesta?) And how Sea World's also built a water-park but buying a ticket only gets you into a portion of the park

At the end of the conversation, he suggests that he might want to walk around Tells me about his experiences with the VA office, the meds he took, how his knee replacement was the best thing ever.

He leaves, and a pirate hat drops in front of me
I look up and see a kid peeking through glass wall - he either threw it or dropped it on accident

I pack up my laptop and decide to bring it up to the 2nd/3rd floor

By the time I get there, I see no parent, child, or any group of people that even resemble a family

Walked for a bit, saw a family getting into the elevator to head down to the first floor

Then I see a dad, looking down, telling someone that he can't find it anywhere... I approach him and ask - excuse me, are you looking for this?

He's relieved, tells his family that he's found it, tells me to poke my head over the balcony so they can say thank you - I wave to them and head back downstairs



An older woman in a wheel chair approaches me and asks me a question - am I allowed to use my phone while it's plugged in to charge? I said yes, totally. She said someone told her that she wasn't allowed to do that and it could break the phone. She said she killed her battery on the flight by using it too much. I tell her it's fine and if she needs to, she can always use mine.
